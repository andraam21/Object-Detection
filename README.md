### Object Detection

```There are two types of detection that are applied on a short video in order to find the objects and the people from it.
This elements are integrated in a coloured rectangle in order to be easily observed and then processed. To apply simultaneously
the two filters in main function are started two parallel threads. Also, the implementations are done in singleton classes, so
that we can initialize just once the filter that it will be further used.
